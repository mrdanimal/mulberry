## What Is a Puppy

A puppy is a fluffy bundle of joy

Who can turn any object into a toy

With four paws and a wagging tail

He will try and beat you to pick up the mail

He likes to chew on anything new

A ball, a bone or even a shoe

He loves to run and likes to be
Chasing the neighbours cat up a tree

A puppy is loveable and so cute

Even when he ruins your favourite boot

His adoring look will melt your heart

And you know from him you won’t want to part

A puppies love just grows and grows

Through all of the little highs and lows

He truly will be your best friend

A great companion to the end.
