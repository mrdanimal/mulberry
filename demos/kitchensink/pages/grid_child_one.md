Just here to be a part of the grid view

<p>'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful  child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you  know.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're  a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p>

<p>This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a  minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're  looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me  whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'</p>

<p>'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking  for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't  like them raw.'</p>

<p>'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled  down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as  she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and  every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she  remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and  she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the  other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had  succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p>

<p>It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it  felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,  and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done  now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going  to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right  size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden&mdash;how IS that  to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open  place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives  there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,  I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the  righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she  had brought herself down to nine inches high.</p>

<p>For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what  to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the  wood&mdash;(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a  fish)&mdash;and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened  by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a  frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all  over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,  and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p>
