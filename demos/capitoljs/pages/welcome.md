Good afternoon agent. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves
the learning of the programming language JavaScript and how to use it properly
and effectively. You will be joined by an intimate task force of elite members
of the JavaScript community to assist you in this task. You may select to
attend either or both of the evening social events occurring the night before
and night of the event. This event is happening on September 18th, 2011 in
Washington, DC at the [Hotel Palomar](http://www.hotelpalomar-arlington.com/).
If you accept this mission, be sure to follow
[@capitoljs](http://www.twitter.com/capitoljs) and register today, like all
JSConf events - it will sell out. See you in Washington DC.
